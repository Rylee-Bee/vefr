"""E7.3: waking a group, the free turn that follows, noise, and the warden.

ADR 0014 ("Monster AI", JS only) plus its owner decisions of 2026-10-04
add four things to E0d's sleeping monsters:

  1. **Wake-all.** Waking one member of a linked group marks every other
     living member of that group awake in the SAME monster phase. A
     member 14 tiles from the hero - far outside its own wake radius of
     10 and its own sight of 6 - is awake because the group's leader
     woke, and that is what `test_the_group_wakes_all_together` proves.
  2. **Wake grace.** A monster the group's wake caught spends the phase
     it woke in doing nothing and acts from the next one, so a group
     wakes together and never lands its first blow together. A monster
     that woke on its own - in sight, hit, or woken by noise - has no
     free turn and acts at once, which is E0d's behaviour exactly and
     is what keeps `tests/test_monster_sleep.py` green.
  3. **Noise.** A loud thing the hero does wakes every sleeper within
     earshot: fighting 12, doors 6, chests 6, stairs 8, breaking 8
     tiles, measured Chebyshev. Fighting's call site is `heroAttack`
     here; the doors, chests and stairs are wired in the interaction
     dispatch (`web/player/parts/480-town-input-and-turns.js`) and the
     last section below proves each one through the real woven player.
     Breaking has no call site: the player has no break action to
     attach it to, so `heardBreak` and `NOISE_BREAK` stay the tested-
     but-uncalled reader they are.
  4. **The warden** is awake and never sleeps, so it hunts before
     anything else on the floor does.

The group ids, the leader mark, the leash and the warden mark are read
by the player off the baked spawn records in `window.VEFR_ENEMIES`.
The baker (`src/vefr/cli.py`) does not carry those keys yet - E7.2 owns
that - so every fixture here weaves the pack the shipped way and then
re-bakes the one `window.VEFR_ENEMIES` literal with the keys the
player's reader already looks for. Nothing else about the player is
touched: these are the real woven player, the real turn loop, the real
flood.

Every fixture is a fixed map with fixed numbers - no randomness, no
wall-clock, no mocks. Run with:
