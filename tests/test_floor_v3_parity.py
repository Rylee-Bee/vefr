"""delve v3: the JavaScript twin draws exactly the floor Python draws, stage by stage.

PLAN.md section 2's parity constraint, and this file is its frozen acceptance
test (slice E3). `src/vefr/delve_v3.py` is the spec and the JS part is the
runtime; every floor of the sweep is drawn by BOTH and the two are compared as
canonical JSON. It is written before the twin, on purpose: a parity harness
written after the port records whatever the port happens to do.

The sweep is the cell count PLAN.md section 2 names: **200 seeds x every size x
every floor kind**, plus a stamped half at the two smallest sizes, because the
spec places stamped rooms (E5a) and a twin that cannot place them is not a
twin. Plus a small nonzero-cycle block, because `cycle` is a quarter of the
floor key and a sweep of cycle-0 floors cannot tell a twin that reads the cycle
apart from one that ignores it. Every case is compared at four stage boundaries - plan, layout, graph,
pop - so a mismatch names the stage it starts in instead of only saying the
floor differs. Then the public `generateFloorV3` is compared end to end, retry
ladder and v2 fallback included.

The parity runs through the REAL woven player (`cli.weave_html` of the sample
pack, then `window.VEFR_DELVE` inside it), in jsdom, over the node path
`tests/run.sh` links. `tests/browser/test_floor_v3_parity.py` is the normative
measurement - the same cases in Chromium, and the perf budget of PLAN.md
section 3 at desktop and at the 4x phone proxy. This file measures the budget
on the same engine and asserts the same desktop figure, because a port that is
tens of times over budget in node is tens of times over budget in a browser.

Nothing here reduces the seed count, skips a case, or compares a checksum
where it can compare the floor.
