"""Build the town-states fixture pack (sample-world + a descent + town states).

Slice E8c (ADR 0015): the per-game `story_end` flag, the list-form
`town_states`, the town gate and the progress walk.

The pack is the sample's own town plus three more authored regions, two
Sections in `sections/`, a `descent` naming them by id, and two rules that
record the two vault notes. Every state region is an ordinary authored
region - a copy of the sample's town - because that is the whole claim
`town_states` makes: no patch, no new runtime language.

Neutral engine-test canon only: a town, a tavern, and two Sections whose
wardens are named creatures. The story ends on the second Section's note,
which is what makes the default `king-slain` reachable by the walk.
