/* Descent parity harness: the woven player's JavaScript twin of `locate`
   and the play-time floor must answer exactly what Python answers.

   argv[2] = woven html, argv[3] = JSON cases made by pytest:
   {"descent": <the pack's descent block>, "depths": [1, 2, ...],
    "runs": [0, 1]}.
   Prints {"hasApi": bool, "located": [...], "plans": [...]}.

   A second descent may come with the cases as `blueprintDescent`, with
   `blueprintDepths`: the same block plus the pack's Blueprint, which is
   what a floor resolves its families through. It is planted exactly as
   the first one is - the player reads the block at call time - and its
   answers come back under `blueprint`.

   A third may come as `rolled`: `{descent, depths, items}`. The catalog
   is planted on `window.VEFR_ITEMS` for the duration of that block only -
   the same global the weave writes, read at call time - so the rolled
   draws (ADR 0017) are compared in both languages against a Python floor
   drawn from the same catalog. */
