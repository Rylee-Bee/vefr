"""E0d: sleeping monsters and a radius-bounded distance flood.

Before E0d every living monster takes a turn on every player turn: the
monster turn floods the whole floor (`distMap`) to path, and any monster
out of the hero's sight drifts toward its nearest ally. E0d bounds that
world in two ways:

  1. A monster is ASLEEP unless it is within max(10, its own sight)
     tiles (Manhattan) of the hero. An asleep monster does not move,
     does not attack and does no work at all. Every monster here carries
     the default sight of 6, so the wake radius is 10 tiles.
  2. The distance flood stops at (the wake distance) + 4 tiles around
     the hero - 14 tiles at sight 6 - instead of covering the whole
     floor.

To make the flood observable the implementation publishes
`window.VEFR_FLOOD_STATS` beside the other harness surfaces:
`{floods, tiles, maxSpan}`, reset at the start of every `enemyTurn()`
and updated by `distMap` for that turn only. The harness reads once at
the end of a run, so every read below is the LAST monster turn.

What is proven here:

  - two far monsters hold still while the hero walks five tiles; under
    the old code the pair drifts toward each other, so this fails today;
  - a lone far monster wakes and steps toward the hero when the hero
    comes within the wake radius; today it walks in as soon as the
    hero is inside its own sight - twelve tiles out, where this test
    wants it still asleep at eleven - so this fails today;
  - the flood stats are published and stay inside the radius; today the
    global does not exist and the flood covered the whole floor, so
    this fails today;
  - an awake monster inside the radius keeps chasing one step a turn;
  - the fight next to the hero (the pale thing walks in, the cellar rat
    hits back) is exactly what it was. That one passed before E0d too:
    it is the guard, not the proof.

Every fixture is a fixed map with fixed numbers - no randomness, no
wall-clock, no mocks. Run with: bash tests/run.sh tests/test_monster_sleep.py
