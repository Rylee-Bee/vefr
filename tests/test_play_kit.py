"""The shared test kit (docs/research/size-and-language-pass.md, pass 2 items 1 and 2). FROZEN CONTRACT.

tests/fixtures/play.mjs: one jsdom runner driven by a data spec, replacing a 35-line copy in every harness.
  node play.mjs <woven.html> '<spec json>'  ->  prints {"reads": {...}, "errors": [...], "store": {...}}
  spec = {"store": {key: value}, "steps": [...], "read": [...]}
  steps:  "begin"            click the title Begin and wait for window.VEFR_COMBAT, then settle 400 ms
          "wait:MS"          wait
          "key:e"            a keydown on the document (key name as KeyboardEvent.key)
          "dir:right"        click the on-screen pad button for that direction
          "walk:down,down"   several dir presses, 10 ms apart
          "click:#sel"       click the first element matching the selector
          "menu:PANEL"       click #menu-open, then the menu button [data-panel="PANEL"]
  reads:  "NAME" or "NAME.a.b"   a window global (JSON-cloned), optionally a dotted path into it (arrays by index)
          "text:#sel"        the element's text, or null
          "exists:#sel"      true/false
          "visible:#sel"     exists and neither it nor an ancestor is hidden
          "store"            the whole localStorage as an object (also always returned as "store")
  An unknown step or read makes the process exit 2 with one plain sentence on stderr.
tests/play_kit.py (Python side):
  weave(pack_dir, tmp_path) -> Path of the woven html;  play(html, spec) -> the parsed output (raises RuntimeError with the
  stderr on a non-zero exit);  pack(tmp_path, base, patch=None) -> a fixture pack built from a named base
  ("interact", "lock", "events", "combat", ...) with a JSON merge patch applied: patch = {"world.json": {...}} deep-merges
  into that file; a value of null deletes the key; the base builder's own output is never mutated.
