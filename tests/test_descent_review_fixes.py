"""The three findings of the vefr#308 second-family review, one test each.

Not a frozen contract: this file is the review pass. Each test here is
one finding, written to fail on the head it reviews:

1. the save was trimmed by the documented order but the trim could stop
   before the byte budget, so `store.setJSON` wrote over `SAVE_BYTES`;
2. returning to town cleared kills and chests but left the floor drops,
   so one Section reset in two halves;
3. Start over cleared the storage, swallowed a refusal and reloaded, so
   the player was told a fresh start over a save that was still there.

The first and the third need a storage of their own, so they run
through `descent_review_harness.mjs` against the REAL woven player: the
byte budget is proved on what the player's own `saveDoc` leaves in
storage, and Start over is proved against a storage that refuses one
remove the way a full or private-mode browser does. The second is a
walk, so it is played through the shared play kit the way the frozen
lifecycle tests are.

A second round of the same review (vefr#314) added two more, at the end
of this file and proved the same way: Start over erased the save when
the browser would not store the new one, and the budgets counted UTF-16
code units rather than the UTF-8 bytes the save is actually written as.
