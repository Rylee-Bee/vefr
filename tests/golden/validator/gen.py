"""Capture the validator golden from the code as it stands. Run once on main, before any
migration, then never again without a written reason: `uv run python tests/golden/validator/gen.py`.

S2 added the `rules` and `album` cases (the two `when` validators), BEFORE the migration, with the
reason in tests/test_event_table.py: S0 captured `saves` and `sound` only, so the sentences this
slice moves onto one table were never pinned, and the sentence the plan expected to regenerate
("the six events") had already been corrected on main by c364adb. Nothing was regenerated or
edited after the migration: the added cases are the proof that moving the vocabulary onto
`shapes.EVENTS` changed no sentence and no order."""
