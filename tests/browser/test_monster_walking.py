"""The monsters' walking, in a real browser.

The rest of this suite drives the studio - the builder, not a woven
player. This one opens a woven file itself (a fixture floor with a wall
in it) over a plain local server, which is how a player meets the game:
one file, opened and played. Chromium draws it for real; the numbers
come from the file's own VEFR_COMBAT snapshot, the same one the jsdom
harness in tests/fixtures reads.

Three things are proved here, and all three are about the floor rather
than about a straight line:

  - a monster walks the long way round a wall to reach the hero, and
    hits them;
  - a monster hurt to a third of what it walked in with runs instead of
    closing;
  - two monsters who cannot see the hero drift toward each other.

Deterministic: the fixture is fixed and nothing in the movement path
rolls dice, so every position below is pinned.
