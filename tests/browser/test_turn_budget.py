"""ADR 0014's turn budget: 37 awake monsters on a 128x96 floor.

ADR 0014's Acceptance names this file:

    tests/browser/test_turn_budget.py: with 37 awake monsters on a
    128x96 floor, a turn takes at most 8 ms on desktop and at most
    30 ms on the phone proxy.

It is a gate, not a bench. `tests/browser/bench_floor_play.py` measures
the same thing across sizes and monster counts and writes a report; that
one is skipped unless `VEFR_BENCH=1`, because a bench is not a contract.
This one is the contract, so it runs with the rest of the browser suite
and skips only when Chromium is not installed (the conftest's `browser`
fixture), exactly like every other test in this directory.

What is measured is the shipped AI, verbatim: parts 410, 420 and 430 are
concatenated into a page and their `enemyTurn` is timed with everything
else they call stubbed to no-ops. No shipped line is edited, no AI is
reimplemented here, and the measurement is the same `performance.now()`
window around the same call `docs/research/endless-e0.md` measured.

The floor is a real one. `vefr.delve_v3` draws a 128x96 floor, and the
37 awake monsters stand on that floor's own spawn tiles: the 36 the pop
stage drew plus the warden on its hall anchor, which is ADR 0014's "36
monsters, plus the warden". The room count is 40 rather than the 32 of
PLAN.md section 3's 128x96 row, because the budget is
`clamp(walkable // 30, 4, 36)` and 32 rooms leave 976 walkable tiles,
which budgets 32 monsters. 40 rooms leave 1,109, which reaches the cap
- this test needs a floor that is actually full.

Two things make the number mean what it says:

  - **Every sample is a whole turn.** The roster is reset to its spawn
    tiles, awake, before each sample, and the harness counts how many
    monsters `enemyAct` was called for. That count has to be 37 on every
    sample. A turn that ended on the first monster - a hero cornered by
    its own floor - is the fastest turn there is and would pass any
    budget while measuring nothing, so the count is asserted, not
    assumed. Nothing starts next to the hero either: the pop stage keeps
    every spawn `STAIR_CLEAR` (7) tiles off the stairs, and the test says
    so out loud rather than trusting it.
  - **The phone proxy is a 4x CPU throttle**, `Emulation.setCPUThrottlingRate`,
    the same proxy `docs/research/endless-e0.md` and
    `tests/browser/bench_floor_play.py` use, rather than a phone-sized
    viewport. A narrower window changes layout, not CPU.

The gate is on the p95 of 40 samples, not the slowest of 40. The ADR's
"at most 8 ms" is about the turn that has to fit a frame, and a single
sample carries whatever the machine was doing; the same rule the
generator's own budget test uses (`tests/test_floor_perf.py`). p50 and
the worst sample are printed, so a budget that is being scraped is
visible in the output rather than only in the pass.
