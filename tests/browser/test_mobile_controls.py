"""The mobile controls (390x844, the iPhone-class portrait window).

Three rules, Rylee 2026-10-07:
  1. The control bar (d-pad + action row) sits in a stable box: its outer
     position does not reflow when the HUD's text content changes. The
     HUD grows downward as the world grows lines; the controls stay at
     the bottom of the stage, at the same rect, every state.
  2. Nothing covers a control; tap targets are at least 44x44 CSS px;
     safe-area-insets (the OS home indicator at the bottom, the status
     bar at the top, the rounded corners at the sides) are respected.
  3. Buggy controls, found one by one, are fixed at the root.

The device insets are real. The test drives them through Chromium's own
`Emulation.setSafeAreaInsetsOverride` (the protocol hook behind DevTools'
device mode), so `env(safe-area-inset-*)` reports what a phone with a chin
and rounded corners reports. The test never writes a --sai-* value itself:
doing that would prove the offset arithmetic and nothing about whether the
OS insets reach the page at all. Two things have to hold for that, and both
are asserted here: the page asks the OS for its whole canvas
(`viewport-fit=cover` in 010-head.html - without it env() is 0 on every
device), and the style sheet reads env() rather than a baked number.

The browser hands back three things we trust:
  - the meta viewport tag the page shipped;
  - the live `--sai-*` values the OS reports (set on :root by the browser
    from the device metrics; 0 on a desktop page);
  - the rendered rect of every named control.

Uses the interact fixture (an 11x7 map: small on purpose, so it is
letterboxed on any window). The HUD is forced to its widest state
(HP + level + gold + bag strip + light) before measuring, so the
test does not pass on a HUD that hides the bug.
