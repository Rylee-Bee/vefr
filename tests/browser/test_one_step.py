"""One key press, one tile: an arrow-key step in a real browser.

NOTE - the report "one key press moves the hero about four tiles" did NOT
reproduce. A single ArrowRight keypress (page.keyboard.press: a tap, not a
held key) moves the hero exactly one tile, read through the player's own
window.VEFR_COMBAT snapshot - the same hook tests/browser/test_monster_walking.py
uses. On worlds/sample-world's town floor the hero went [3, 4] -> [4, 4]:
x +1, y +0. Nothing in the movement path chains a keypress.

What looks like a multi-tile jump is display scale, not a logic bug. The
player draws a tile at T = town.tile * fitZoom(), and fitZoom() scales a
whole map up as far as 3x (and the hero sprite is drawn 1.5 tiles tall), so
one tile of travel can LOOK like several pack tiles: measured, one step was
32px in the foggy sample town (T = 32) and 96px on the no-fog wall fixture
(T = 3 x town.tile = 96). In addition, a HELD arrow key chains moves because
the keydown handler has no e.repeat guard: the browser's own key auto-repeat
delivers repeated keydown events, each calling move() once (4 synthetic
repeat=true events moved the hero 4 tiles). The press made here does not hold
the key, so it moves exactly one tile. Behaviour was therefore left unchanged;
no engine test hook was needed (VEFR_COMBAT already exposes the hero tile).
