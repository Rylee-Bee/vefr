"""Rolled loot: rarity at once, traits hidden (ADR 0017, T3 slice 1).

One drop draw now yields a base item plus a rarity the player sees at
once, plus traits that stay hidden until the thing is identified. The
draw is deterministic from the run seed, every key is optional and
additive, and a pack that names none of them is the pack it was.

This file pins four things, and the names say which:

  * the SHAPE - `shapes.ITEM` and `shapes.check_item`, and that they read
    only the three keys this slice added;
  * the four REFUSALS `vefr check` speaks, one test each;
  * the DRAW - the same seed twice draws the same thing, a different floor
    key or a different monster draws a different one, and every stream is
    a named stream off the floor key;
  * the BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY PROOF - an unmodified pack's catalog bakes
    the same bytes and its floors drop the same ids.

Plus the reveal rule: the rarity is in the bag's own words, in the same
line as the item's name, with no timer or animation anywhere in that path
(motion off makes no difference to a reveal that never waits), and the
hidden traits are not written into the DOM at all.
