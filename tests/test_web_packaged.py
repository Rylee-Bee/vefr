"""The packaged file's pool-draw runtime, executed for real.

`ratatoskr weave --pool N` bakes `window.VEFR_POOL` into the
dist/<world>.html single file; the file's own poolDraw() then serves
lines when no live endpoint answers. Until now that runtime was only
ever exercised by hand - the DOM harness runs index.html, not the
packaged file (it pulls in canvas + the full app).

This test closes that gap the cheap-but-real way: it builds a real
packaged file through cmd_build_web with the generators monkeypatched
to canned outputs (no LLM), extracts the ACTUAL shipped pool block
from the built HTML - `const POOL_USED` through the end of
poolDraw(), between the file's own section markers - plus the baked
window.VEFR_POOL line, and hands both to tests/fixtures/pool_harness.mjs,
which executes them in a node vm sandbox and drives the semantics:
asked-for combo first, no repeats, cross-combo fallthrough, null when
spent, persistence across reload.

Known limit, stated plainly: this does NOT drive the packaged app's
button-level flow (click -> fetch fail -> catch -> poolDraw) in a
stub DOM - packaged.html's town canvas makes the full-app harness a
bigger job. The catch-block wiring is asserted statically instead.
