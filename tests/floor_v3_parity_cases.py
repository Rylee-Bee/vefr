"""The cases the delve v3 parity test replays, and the Python side of them.

Shared by `tests/test_floor_v3_parity.py` (the node/jsdom path `tests/run.sh`
links) and `tests/browser/test_floor_v3_parity.py` (the normative Chromium
measurement), so the two paths replay exactly the same floors and compare
exactly the same strings.

Three things live here:

1. **The sweep.** 200 seeds x every size of PLAN.md section 3 x every floor
   kind, which is the cell count PLAN.md section 2 names for the parity test,
   plus a stamped half at the two smallest sizes (E5b's JS half - the spec can
   place stamped rooms and the twin has to place the same one).
2. **The Python reference**, `staged()`: one attempt of one floor key, kept at
   its stage boundaries. It is `delve_v3._attempt` line for line with the
   stage outputs kept instead of thrown away, so the harness can compare
   plan, then layout, then graph, then pop, and a mismatch names the stage it
   starts in rather than only saying the floor differs.
3. **The canonical form**, `canonical()`: `json.dumps` with sorted keys and no
   whitespace on this side, and `tests/fixtures/floor_plan_canon.mjs` on the
   other. Every value in a FloorPlan is an ASCII key, a whole number, a
   boolean, null, or a string of ASCII glyphs, so the two serialisations are
   byte-identical for equal values - which is what makes "the same bytes after
   canonicalisation" a comparison and not a hope.
