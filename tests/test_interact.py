"""The woven player's one-button interact logic, executed for real.

`design/one-button-interact.md` folds the three old use paths into one
verb. Task 1 is the pure half: a self-contained block in
web/packaged.html between its own marker comments exposes
interactTargets, pickTarget and labelFor over a plain state object -
no DOM, no storage, no clock, no randomness, no reads of the file's
other variables.

This closes the gap the way tests/test_web_pack_tiles.py does: it
extracts the REAL block from web/packaged.html between its marker
comments and runs it in a node vm sandbox that needs no npm packages,
then checks every value the harness pins. The marker and purity rules
are asserted from the shipped source text.
