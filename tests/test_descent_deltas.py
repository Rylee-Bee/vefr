"""Play-time floors, save deltas: the save is a set of deltas, never a grid.

A floor that was never baked at weave time is generated when the hero
reaches the stair, and what is remembered about it is a handful of bytes:
who was killed, what was taken, what was dropped where, which secrets
were found, and the explored bitset. Nothing else, and never the map
itself. This is acceptance 2 of the slice - the budgets of PLAN §3, the
40-floor cap and its eviction - played through the REAL woven file in
jsdom, with the trim and the byte counts taken by the player's own code.

Also the jsdom half of acceptance 1: the same seed after a reload draws
the same floor. (The Chromium half is tests/browser/test_descent_reload.py.)

One honest limit of the harness, the same one the shipped game has: the
save remembers the floors, not where the hero stood, so every session
starts at the town's own wake point and walks the whole descent again.
The walks below are therefore planned against the very floor the
generator drew, and a fixture with nothing in it is used where the walk
itself is what is being proved.
