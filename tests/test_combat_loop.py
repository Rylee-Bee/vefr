"""The combat loop, mechanical half (pleasant-loop protocol).

The combat harness EXECUTES the woven single-file player against a stub
DOM and plays the first fight end to end: bump the adjacent enemy, watch
it hit back, kill it and see it stay dead, watch a distant enemy inside
its sight step toward the hero, then take a fatal blow and wake whole at
the baked wake point. It also plays the loot loop (the kill leaves its
drop on the floor, stepping onto it takes it into the bag, and a chest
gives its note and its items) and the reward loop (sell and buy at a
shopkeeper's fixed prices, then drink a potion that heals up to the
max and says so when there is nothing to heal). Deterministic: the
fixture is fixed, so every number here is pinned.
