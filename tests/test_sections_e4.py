"""E4 (endless dungeon): Sections - the pack shape, the depth curve, the
pattern, the landings, and the sweep over Sections. FROZEN: written before
`src/vefr/sections.py` and before the `section` block on the schema table.

PLAN.md section 2 is the spec this file is written from, and the four
rules of the determinism section are the ones with teeth here:

- `locate(depth, pack)` is pure and derived only from the pack's Section
  list, and the story is cycle 0;
- `floor_key` is `run_seed/section.id/cycle/k`;
- a floor is identified by `(gen version, section content hash, floor_key)`,
  so editing a pack's Section data invalidates that Section's floors;
- no float but `floor(rng() * n)` with `0 <= n < 2^31`, and no draw out of
  a dictionary - every list below is a list, sorted, with ties broken by
  index.

Where each part of the slice is pinned:

| what | where in this file |
|---|---|
| the Section pack shape and its sentences | `tests/golden/validator/cases.json` (block `section`), `tests/test_validator_golden.py` |
| the block's refusals, in this file's own words | "the block" |
| the depth curve | "the depth curve" |
| the floor pattern, the special floor's kind | "the pattern" |
| landings, the recorded ones, the flag each sets | "landings" |
| floor identity: the key, the content hash | "floor identity" |
| weighted families, resolved from the Blueprint by id | "the families" |
| `vefr check` sweeps every Section x 200 seeds | "the sweep" |
| a second fixture pack, different Section data, no code change | "two packs" |
| the bake: nine floors, doors, the landing up-stairs | "the bake" |

The two fixture packs are `tests/fixtures/sections/cellar` and
`tests/fixtures/sections/attic`. They are committed Section DATA - a
Blueprint, an affix list and one `sections/<id>.json` each - and they are
deliberately unlike one another: nine floors against eleven, 64x48
against 48x32, three families against two with the weights the other way
round, three special kinds against one, one loot tier against two. Every
test that reads one of them reads the other through the same code, which
is the whole of acceptance 3: a Section is data, not a hardcoded cellar.

The names in both packs are placeholders and stay that way. Section
names, warden assignments, vault notes and points of interest are gated
on Rylee (PLAN.md section 6), so nothing here is canon and nothing here
is meant to become canon.
