"""The one-button Interact verb, played for real (interact play protocol).

The interact play harness EXECUTES the woven single-file player against
a stub DOM (jsdom) and plays the interact fixture pack
(tests/fixtures/make_interact_pack.py) end to end: every key the verb
answers to - E, Space, Enter and F - next to the resident, the door,
the chest and the trader; the nothing-in-reach case with full state
snapshots either side, so NOT ONE turn can slip through; the target
ring proved draw-only; and the regression half proving every action
that was reachable before the wiring still works (the Talk button, a
canvas click, the Interact button on chest/trade/door, a bump, and one
arrow press moving exactly one tile). Deterministic: the fixture's
coordinates and the save seed are pinned, so every string and snapshot
here is pinned too.
