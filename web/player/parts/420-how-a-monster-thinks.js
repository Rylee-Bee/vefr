  // records in `window.VEFR_ENEMIES`. `loadEnemies` (part 410) builds a
  // fresh live record for every spawn and copies across only the fields
  // the pack named a long time ago, so `prepareMinds` reads them here,
  // once per roster, and every question about a group is asked of the
  // fields it sets. A pack that names no group - every pack today -
  // leaves them empty and nothing below it runs.
  //
  // Nothing about a group is ever saved. `loadEnemies` builds a new

  // asleep the moment a region loads; the home maps below live in
  // memory for the length of the visit and are dropped with them.
  //

  // be a cap of three here, on the reading that a fourth map cost more
  // than the turn budget allows. What the cap actually cost is a pack's
  // fourth group walking unheld: ADR 0014 says a member never steps
  // farther than `leash` from home, and it says it of every member, so a
  // home map that is refused is a member that chases the hero across the
  // floor and never walks home. The map is cut off at `leash + 1` steps
