"""`vefr stamp check` - the gate a stamp pack passes before a floor uses it.

ADR 0013's Validation section, in four parts:

- **static** - the reader's own rules, one sentence each, and this is
  the check that owns the sentence an author reads first.
- **fit** - a required-role room has to be a third of the small side of
  every Section that uses it, or it can never be placed and the author
  would only find out over a hundred silent sweeps.
- **sweep** - lay the pack's floors and count how often each stamp came
  out. Required roles have to be on every floor they are eligible for;
  optional ones may be rare on purpose and have no minimum (owner
  decision 4); the sweep only reports how often they place. A floor that
  fell back to v2 over a stamp carries the role that would not place in
  `stamp_defect`, and the sweep reports that too: a share says how often,
  the defect says why.
- **graph** - read a floor back and complain about a stamped room with
  no door in use, or with an anchor the hero cannot walk to.

Everything here measures the generator rather than reimplementing it:
the sweep asks `delve_v3` the same questions a floor asks, so a check
that passes means the floor works and not that a second copy of the
placer agrees with the first.

The report is one sentence per problem and a count at the end. A pack
with nothing wrong says so in a line, because a check that only speaks
when it is unhappy is a check nobody runs.
