"""The world pack loader - the seam between the engine and the story.

The engine (src/vefr) never hardcodes world content. Everything the
story owns - phases, voices, bonds, regions (town and dungeon), the
surface - lives in a pack directory. Two shapes are supported:

  Flat shape (legacy / simple packs):
    worlds/<name>/
      world.json
      logbok.md
      ledger.md
      map.md
      voices/*.md                 # speaker voice prompts
      voices/<name>.fragments.md  # optional: speakable lines for
                                  # offline play (bullet lines)

  Acts shape (multi-region, self-contained per act):
    worlds/<name>/
      world.json              # engine contract: title, phases, surface, acts[]
      logbok.md               # pack-level canon (shared across acts)
      ledger.md               # pack-level voice anchors (shared)
      acts/
        act-1/
          world.json          # act-level contract: id, title, regions, speakers,
                              #   enemies, bosses, transitions, vault_intro
          town/
            map.md
            contract.json     # region metadata (legend, pois, hero_start, ...)
            voices/*.md
            sprites/*
            tiles/*           # optional: the region's own ground pictures
          dungeon/
            map.md
            contract.json
            voices/*.md
            sprites/*
            tiles/*

  REGIONS + TRANSITIONS (doors between maps): an act's `regions` is a
  list (or dict) of region names, one directory each. A region's map
  lives in its `map.md`; its geometry (legend, pois, poi_text,
  hero_start, sanctuary_tiles, watch, water_by_phase, flood_tiles,
  tile, bg, `fog` and the colours) lives in that region's
  `contract.json`. `fog` (true, or {"radius": N}) makes the woven player
  draw the region dark until it is explored - a lit circle around the
  hero, walked ground remembered dimmed, the rest black. Omit it and the
  region is drawn whole (a town).
  An act's `transitions` is a list of doors between those maps:

      {"from": "town", "at": [4, 5],
       "to": "cottage", "to_at": [4, 3]}

  `at` is the tile you step on in `from`; `to_at` is where the hero
  lands in `to`. A speaker may carry `"region": "<region name>"`; a
  speaker with no `region` belongs to the act's first region. Each
  loaded region carries its own `speakers` dict (the act's speakers
  filtered to that region), while the act's `speakers` keeps all of
  them.

The loader returns a single canonical shape regardless of which on-disk
shape the pack uses: top-level keys are the world's metadata (title,
phases, surface, logbok, ledger, acts), and `acts` is ALWAYS a list
with at least one element. Flat packs are loaded as a single implicit
act so every consumer can use the same access pattern.

  world = load_world()
  world["title"]                          # the world's title
  world["phases"]                         # {whispers: ..., doubts: ..., ...}
  world["surface"]                        # "combat" | "investigation" | "plain"
  world["acts"]                           # [act1, act2, ...] - always a list
  world["_current_act"]                   # 0 for now; future PRs advance this
  current_act(world)                      # world["acts"][world["_current_act"]]
  current_act(world)["regions"]["town"]   # the town of the active act

SURFACE: world.json may declare a 'surface' field - one of 'combat',
'investigation', 'plain'. The surface is the *grammar* the player
sees (HP bars, encounter prompts, investigation dice), not the
engine's actual behavior. The engine never gates the player on HP,
attack, or roll results - the surface is a costume over the
underlying rumor engine. Default surface is 'combat' for
back-compat with existing packs.

JOURNEY: the engine's story structure is the Hero's Journey, told
through four Elder Futhark runes. The mapping lives in journey.py.
Packs can rename their phases (any keys the author wants) but the
journey-stage anchors are positional - first phase in `phases` maps
to the first rune, and so on.

PACK LAW (per act): every act may declare how it plays -
  `floor`   - how hard the numbers bite: 'costume' (default; the
              HP bar is a costume, the player never drops to
              zero), 'story' (failure bends the narrative), or
              'stakes' (the numbers bite). The engine owns no
              opinion; each world declares its own floor.
  `tone`    - the act's position on the ridiculous-literal dial
              ('literal' | 'warm' | 'deadpan' | 'ridiculous' |
              'absurd'). The storyteller prompt carries it.
  `ruleset` - which ruleset module the act plays under
              ('ambient' default; ruleset modules land in future
              PRs).
  `verbs`   - the act's own action vocabulary. When declared, it
              replaces the engine's costume verbs entirely (a
              cooking act can offer plate/flip/serve).
  `enemies` / `bosses` - reserved shape for the rulesets that need
              them; validated, echoed by inspect, consumed by
              ruleset modules as they land.
  `transitions` - the act's doors between regions: a list of
              {from, at, to, to_at} steps (see REGIONS + TRANSITIONS
              above). The woven player honours them; maplab.validate
              checks the door tiles. Validated, echoed by inspect,
              consumed by ruleset modules as they land.
All of these are optional; absent means the engine's defaults, so
every existing pack loads unchanged.

ITEMS / LOOT (first slice): world.json may carry an optional top-level
  `items` catalog, keyed by id:
      {"cloudy-potion": {"name": "a cloudy potion", "sprite": "potion"}}
  `name` is plain words; `sprite` names an entry in `player.sprites` and
  is optional. A region enemy may carry `drops` (a list of catalog ids),
  and a chest book (`chest: yes`) may carry `drops:` (a comma-separated
  list of catalog ids in its front matter). A killed enemy leaves its
  drop on the floor it died on; walking onto a drop takes it into the
  bag (`localStorage['vefr-bag-<world>']`). The woven player bakes the
  catalog (`VEFR_ITEMS`) and each drop. An item may also carry optional
  `value` (a positive int: what a shop pays and asks), `heal` (a positive
  int) and `use` (a verb such as `drink`); with none of them the item
  bakes exactly as before. Nothing is identified yet.
  An item may carry an optional `light`, in one of two forms:
      {"light": {"radius": 2, "turns": 5}}   # wider for a while
      {"light": {"reveal": true}}            # the whole region at once
  `radius` (int 1..20) widens the fog's lit circle by that many tiles for
  `turns` (int 1..999) hero turns, then it gutters out; `reveal` marks
  every tile of the region explored in one use. Using either from the Bag
  spends one copy; in a region with no dark (or the player's fog turned
  off) it says so and spends nothing. With no `light` the item bakes
  exactly as before. maplab checks the shape and ranges.

REWARD (first slice): `world.player` may carry `gold`, the starting
  purse (a non-negative int; default 0), kept per world at
  `localStorage['vefr-gold-<world>']`. A speaker whose spec carries
  `"shop": "true"` (also `yes`/`1`) keeps its region's shop - at most one
  per region, the first named wins. Standing beside that speaker and
  using the world's interact verb opens a Trade panel (sell carried
  things with a `value`, buy catalog things with a `value`); a carried
  thing with a `heal` can be used from the Bag panel. The woven player
  bakes `VEFR_HERO.gold` and `VEFR_SHOPS` ({region: speaker key}). All of
  it is optional: a pack that names none of it bakes the player it had
  before.

GRAMMARS: `world.json` may carry a top-level `grammars` object: a
set of tiny, hand-written sentence recipes the engine expands
offline, with no model and no baked pool. Each grammar maps a rule
name to a non-empty list of strings and must carry an `origin` rule,
where expansion starts; `#rule#` inside a string expands to one
entry of that rule, and every other character is kept as written:

  "grammars": {
    "whisper": {"origin": ["#who# says #news#."],
                "who": ["the innkeeper"],
                "news": ["the road east is watched"]},
    "weather": {"origin": ["#sky# over #place#."],
                "sky": ["Rain"], "place": ["the town"]},
    "name":    {"origin": ["#adj# #noun#"],
                "adj": ["Grey"], "noun": ["Hollow"]}
  }

Every `#rule#` must name a rule in the same grammar, and the
expander caps one expansion at 200 draws, so a grammar that points at
itself stops instead of looping. The engine reads `whisper` when a
woven player has no live endpoint, no pool, and no fragment banks
(the woven file carries the same algorithm in `web/packaged.html`);
`weather` on arriving in a region; `name` to name a floor that
`norns delve` generates. Every part is optional and a pack with no
`grammars` behaves exactly as it always has. maplab validates the
block. See grammar.py and docs/guides/grammars.md.

STEFNA / BELL VOICE: a pack may declare an optional top-level
`stefna_voice` (string naming which speaker writes the sealed letter;
absent means "the pack's first declared voice"). Every voice declared
in the pack must carry a non-empty `strike` string prompt for that
letter.

VOICES CONVENTION: flat packs place voice prompt files at pack-level
`voices/<name>.md`. Acts-shaped packs place them at the region level
under `acts/<id>/<region>/voices/<name>.md`, discovered by convention
matching the file stem. Flat and acts resolution is unified via
`resolve_voice_file()`.

TILES CONVENTION: a region may bring its own ground pictures in a
`tiles/` directory beside `sprites/` (flat packs use pack-level
`tiles/`). A tile is named by its file stem - `stone-wall.webp` is the
picture for the legend's `"tile": "stone-wall"`. A tile may have
numbered variants tried in order: `stone-wall.webp` is variant 1 and
is optional, then `stone-wall.2.webp`, `stone-wall.3.webp`, and so
on. A name with only numbered files is legal - there is no required
unnumbered file. The player picks a variant deterministically, so the
same pack always looks the same; a pack with no tiles/ resolves tiles
from the engine set exactly as before.

VISIBLE ENGINE: every load step is recorded to the weave log so the
author can see exactly what the loader did. See weave.py.
