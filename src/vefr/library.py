"""The Library - books and notes a world keeps, and the studio's own shelf.

A pack may carry a `library/` folder of markdown books, one file each:

    worlds/<name>/library/a-miners-note.md

    title: A Miner's Note
    found: map            # shelf | map | resident | earned  (default: shelf)
    at: [7, 4]            # map: the tile the book lies on (x, y)
    region: town          # map: which region (default: town)
    speaker: keeper       # resident: the voice that hands it over

    The first page.

    * * *

    The second page.

A line holding only `* * *` starts a new page. The author writes every
word; the engine only reads, checks and shows them. No model call ever
touches a book (the Library is a deterministic surface, like export).

The engine's own shelf lives in `web/library/` in the same format: the
studio handbook, how games are made. It belongs to no world.

Earned books name the moment that unlocks them (`when`). The events the
engine knows are in EARNED_EVENTS; `book:<id>` means "after reading that
book". The finding itself happens in play (a later slice); this module
defines the contract, loads it, and validates it.
