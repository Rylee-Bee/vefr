"""Can this pack be finished? Follow the locks from the start region.

`findings(pack_dir)` returns plain sentences naming a lock whose key
cannot be reached before it; an empty list means every item-locked door
can be opened with a key the hero can obtain first. A pack with no
`requires` at all produces no findings.

`section_findings(pack_dir, seeds)` is the second half, and it came with
the Sections (E4, PLAN.md section 5 row E4): the PLAN.md section 7
property proof run over Sections rather than over one floor kind. Every
Section in the pack is swept over `seeds` check seeds - every floor of
it, at the Section's own size, drawn from its own floor key - and each
floor has to hold: one component, every anchor, point of interest,
secret, monster and chest reachable from the up-stair, and a vault anchor
on a Section that names a vault. A floor that fell back to v2 geometry is
counted and reported as a rate, because a Section whose floors fall back
is a Section that validated green and then drew v2.

The model is the pack's own data, read through the loaders the rest of
the engine already uses: the acts tree (`maplab.load_pack`), the
Library's books (`library.load_library`), the item catalog, and the
Section packs (`vefr.sections`). A key can be obtained from an enemy's
`drops`, a book/chest's `drops` on the map, a shop's `stock`, or a rule
that `give`s it (rules are not regional). Reachability and obtainability
are grown to a fixpoint.

Flag locks (`requires: {"flag": ...}`) are out of scope: a rule may set
the flag, so they are treated as always open and never reported. No
model call, no write, no clock - this is a deterministic surface.
