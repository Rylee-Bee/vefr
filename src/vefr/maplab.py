"""maplab - the map toolkit for world packs.

The lab-wrapper pattern, first piece: one validator shared by the
tests and the CLI, so the map can never be wrong in a way the
tests do not also check.

Subcommands:
  validate  [--pack DIR]            run every geometry check offline
  build     --segments FILE         rebuild the map from run-length
                                    segments: {"rows": [[["H", 4], ...], ...]}
  verify    --url URL               validate the map as actually served
                                    by a live deployment (closes the
                                    baked-but-not-deployed gap)

Walkability mirrors town.js exactly: legend solid flag wins, else
the legacy blocked-char fallback. Reachability is checked in the
least restrictive water state (low water everywhere).

    validator can consume.

    The on-disk shape is one of two:

      Flat shape (legacy): a single world.json with title, phases,
        voices, bonds, town at the top level.
      Acts shape: a pack-level world.json + acts/<id>/world.json
        per act. The map lives in acts/<id>/<region>/map.md.

    The validator downstream reads `w['town']`, `w['speakers']`,
    `w['phases']`, and `w['voices']`. We build a unified dict so
    the validator never has to know which on-disk shape it came
    from. Acts-shape packs are validated against the current act's
    first region (the town in the canary shape).

    The optional `growth` block (design/growth.md) is carried through
    only when the pack declares it, so a pack without one loads
    exactly as before. The optional `skin` field (design/ui-skin.md)
    is carried the same way: only when the pack declares it, so a pack
    without one loads exactly as before. The optional `saves` block
