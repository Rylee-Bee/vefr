"""delve_v3 - the v3 floor generator: five pure stages, one stream each.

PLAN.md section 2 is the spec. `generate_floor_v3` takes a seed, a floor
size, a Section pack and a floor kind, and returns a FloorPlan dict: the
grid, the rooms, the anchors, the points of interest, the secrets, the
monsters and the chests.

The five stages run in a fixed order, each drawing from its own stream
keyed off the floor key:

  1. plan    `v3|<floor_key>|plan`    quotas and flavour, never a wall
  2. layout  `v3|<floor_key>|layout`  spine, stamp rooms, accretion, loops
  3. graph   no draws at all           the room graph, the path, the warden
  4. pop     `v3|<floor_key>|pop`     monsters, elites, groups, chests
  5. validate, and on a failure retry the whole floor with `|try{n}`

The layout stream is the only stream that carves, so a rewritten affix,
group or family table cannot move a wall. That is the sub-seed rule of
PLAN.md section 2. After `MAX_TRIES` retries the caller gets v2 geometry
with `gen: 2`.

PLAN.md section 2 also names a `loot` stream per mob and a `chest`
stream per chest. Neither is drawn by this slice: a FloorPlan carries a
chest's table id and a mob's family and affix, and what is inside either
is the work of the elites and groups slice.

Determinism: `delve.prng` and its 32-bit integer maths are the only
source of randomness. No `random`, no clock, no global, no dictionary is
ever iterated while draws are consumed - every list here is a list.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------- stage 2
# the layout stream - the exact order of draws. `rng()` is one call of
# `prng("v3|" + floor_key + "|layout")`, `rand(lo, hi)` is
# `lo + floor(rng() * (hi - lo + 1))` and `pick(n)` is
# `floor(rng() * n)`. This is the only stage that carves.
#
#  1. row_h = rand(5, 7)          the pitch of a slot row across the
#     short axis, so a room of up to `row_h - 1` tiles and a wall.
#     band = row_h - 1.
#  2. n_slots = (short - 2) // row_h;
#     band_slot = n_slots // 2;   the spine's slot row, the middle one.
#     band_lo = 1 + band_slot * row_h.
#  3. spine: the up-stair end first. Repeat while the plan's quota is
#     not half spent and the cursor is inside the long axis:
#       da = rand(4, 6)            the room's size along the long axis;
#       shape = pick(len(SHAPES));
#       place (cursor, band_lo, da, band); cursor = cursor + da + 1.
#     A draw that will not fit ends the spine, and no further draw is
#     taken. Each room is joined to the one before it with one L-shaped
#     corridor, which takes one draw for the bend.
#  4. accretion: children go on ONE side of the band first, and the
#     side with the most free slot rows wins, the lower one on a tie.
#     The free rows of that side, nearest the spine first, are the rows
#     the children may use. Walk the spine in order and, for each spine
#     room, try those rows in turn. Stop for a room once `cap` children
#     are placed or the quota is met. If the quota is still short when
#     the spine is done, do the whole thing again over the free rows of
#     the other side, in the same order and the same draws; a floor the
#     first pass filled - every floor of the sizes in PLAN.md section 3
#     - takes no draw at all here. Each attempt, in this order and
#     whether or not it is placed:
#       da = rand(3, 5)            the child's size along the long axis;
#       db = rand(3, band)         its size across the short axis.
#     A child is centred on its parent, clamped inside the long axis,
#     skipped when it does not fit its slot row or touches another
#     room, and otherwise placed and joined to its parent by one
#     L-shaped corridor, which takes one draw for the bend.
#  5. the child gallery: on the child side, on the wall row just past
#     the outermost child row - the one row no child's corridor can
#     reach, because every corridor stops at its own room - a run from
#     the first child of that row to the last. It serves every child it
#     runs past, so those rooms gain a second way in and the room graph
#     stops being a tree of dead ends.
#  6. the spine chords, which are the loops. Take the pairs
#       (0, 3), (4, 7), (8, 11), ... clipped to the last spine room,
#     one per four rooms, and the first `plan["loops"]` of them - the
#     one number the plan stage drew that the layout stage reads. Each is
#     closed with a gallery corridor on the wall row just off the band
#     on the side NO child was placed on, so a chord is a region of its
#     own and two chords do not run into one another. A run over four
#     rooms joins all six pairs of those four, and the chain already
#     has three of them, so one chord is three cycles: more than the
#     two PLAN.md section 4 asks for, out of one corridor.
#  7. the stamped rooms (ADR 0013, Placement), last, because a stamp may
#     not land on carved ground. The slots are, in order, warden-hall,
#     vault (only when the pack names one), landmark, then `special`,
#     `secret` and `filler` up to the quotas below. A slot with no
#     eligible stamp of its role takes no draw at all. Per slot:
#       role = pick(total weight of that role's stamps)
#     then, per attempt, up to ATTEMPTS (24) of them, in this order:
#       o = pick(len(allowed))     the orientation, from the allowed set
#       x = rand(1, w - width - 1)  and then
#       y = rand(1, h - height - 1)
#     An attempt that does not fit, or that cannot be reached from one
#     of its own sockets, is spent like any other: the three draws
#     happen, nothing is carved, and the next attempt is taken. A stamp
#     too big for the floor at any orientation gives its slot up at
#     once and takes no draw at all, so a 21x21 room cannot burn a
#     floor's attempt budget on a 48x32 grid. The connection draws
#     nothing: a corridor is routed from the socket mouth to the nearest
#     carved tile, both L-bends tried in a fixed order, and the first
#     route crossing no locked tile wins. A used `+` becomes floor and a
#     used `?` becomes a `secrets` entry; an unused socket becomes wall.
#     A required role still missing fails the floor, which the retry
#     ladder redraws with `|try{n}`; on the LAST try the required roles
#     are pinned to named spots instead, and a role that still fails
#     falls back to v2 with the role reported as a defect.
#
# A chord's own pair is three rooms apart, not four, and its grid gap
# is however wide the spine is. The plan's rule is kept in the order it
# was written and could not be met as written: two rooms four steps
# apart along a chain of this pitch are a dozen tiles from each other,
# so "at least 4 apart in the graph" and "a grid gap of 6 or less" are
# two conditions no pair meets at once. What the sweep measures is the
# cycle, and a chord makes three of them.

#
#  1. A node per room, in `rooms` order, then a node per maximal
#     4-connected run of corridor tiles. Corridor nodes are numbered in

#  2. An edge when a corridor tile is 4-adjacent to a room tile, and
#     when two room tiles are 4-adjacent across no corridor.
#  3. The main path is a breadth-first walk of that region graph from
#     the room holding the up-stair to the room holding the down-stair,
#     neighbours visited in ascending node order, so the lower index
#     wins a tie. Its room nodes, in order, are the main path.
#  4. Distances are counted from the up room over the room graph.
#  5. The warden goes in the farthest room off the main path, ties
#     broken by the lower room index: the gates-and-guardians rule.
#  6. The landmark goes in the next room off the path after that, and
#     the vault in the one after it when the pack names a vault.
#     A room a stamp was painted into is already the room its role
#     names, so it is used instead of being chosen: the warden hall is

#     count and no affix table draws the count and places nothing, so

#     `rand(minion_lo, minion_hi)`, a leader family, a leader tile, then

#     falling back to the next free tile in the candidate list.
#  4. Chests: count = min(rand(2, 2 + quota // 8), the number of rooms
#     off the main path no mob holds). Rooms off the main path first,
#     farthest from the up-stair first; a room whose centre a monster,

#     from CHEST_TABLES per chest. Every chest lands off the main path, so

    """Draw one v3 floor from `seed` and return its FloorPlan.

    `size_range` is the chosen `(w, h)` of the floor and nothing else.
    `section` is a Section pack; only `id`, `rooms`, `families`, `elites`,
    `groups`, `pois`, `stamps` and `vault` are read, every other key is
    defaulted, and a missing key never raises. `floor_kind` is one of
    `normal`, `treasure`, `infested` or `hub`.

    `stamp_pack` is the pack's stamp set as `stamps.load` hands it over:
    a list of read records, already sorted by id. It is the stamped
    rooms ADR 0013 places, and it is empty by default, so a call that
    knows nothing about stamps is byte-for-byte the floor it always was.
    The Section's own `stamps` tags say which of them this Section may
    use, and `depth` is `k`, the floor's 1-based position in its
    Section, which is what a stamp's own `depth` range is measured
    against.

    The floor key is `f"{seed}/{section_id}/{floor_kind}"`, so the same
    seed, section and kind is the same floor, and two kinds of one
    section are two floors. A floor that fails stage 5 is drawn again
    from the same key with `|try{n}` appended, up to `MAX_TRIES` times;
    after that the caller gets v2 geometry with `gen: 2` and the same
    keys. The fallback rate is the fraction of calls that come back with
    a `gen` other than 3. The LAST try pins the required stamps
    (ADR 0013, Placement 4), and a floor that falls back to v2 over a
    stamp carries `stamp_defect` naming the role that would not place.

    `trace`, when given, is a dict the floor writes its key and its
    wanted stamp roles into - what `vefr stamp check` measures a rate
    against. Passing one changes nothing about the floor.

    Deterministic: `delve.prng` is the only source of randomness, so the
    same arguments always return the same plan. Raises `ValueError` for
    a `size_range` that is not a pair of whole numbers of 8 or more, and
    for a `floor_kind` outside `FLOOR_KINDS`.
