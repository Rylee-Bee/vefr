"""delve - the deterministic dungeon-floor generator.

The engine owns the *shape* of a generated floor; the story owns what
the floor means. `generate_floor` draws one floor from a seed using
rectangular rooms joined by L-corridors, marks the up-stair and the
down-stair, and guarantees a single connected cave with the two stairs
reachable from each other. `contract` writes the region contract.json a
generated floor needs, and `LEGEND` is the shared symbol -> tile table.

Everything here is rules-only and deterministic. The only randomness is
`random.Random(seed)` - never the global `random`, and never the clock -
so the same `(seed, width, height, rooms)` always draws the same rows.

Stair distance: `generate_floor` tries to place the down-stair at least
`MIN_STAIR_DISTANCE` (10) Manhattan tiles from the up-stair, so a floor
feels like a walk. If a layout cannot satisfy that after many tries it
relaxes to the widest pair it found rather than fail; the caller can
measure the pair it got.

Two ways in. `norns delve` still bakes floors once, at build time, from
a seed. The descent (E1) draws floors at play time instead: a pack's
`descent` block (`descent_of`) names its Sections, and `floor_plan` draws
the floor at a given depth from the run seed, keyed by
`floor_key(run_seed, section.id, cycle, k)` so each of its streams is
independent and the same run always meets the same floor. The player's
twin, web/player/parts/397-the-descent.js, draws the identical floor.
