"""Blueprint formats 1, 2 and 3 - expand a small source into enemy
records, into things, and into places.

A pack may carry a `blueprint.json` at its root: the edited truth for the
regions it owns. This module is the library half of
`docs/adr/0008-blueprint-format.md` (format 1), `docs/adr/0010` (format
2, `things`; format 3, `places`): the versioned readers, the closed key
sets, the validator and the expander. It adds no runtime and no rule
language - a pack word grants no authority.

Format 1 is acts-shape only. `expand` returns `{region_key: [record]}`
in file order; each record's keys follow `FIELD_ORDER` and absent keys
are skipped. Format 3 keeps that shape and adds `places`: a door, a
stair or a sign, placed by a sentence that only `vefr normalize`
resolves, and written into the region's own `map.md`. Format 2 keeps
format 1's shape and adds `things`, a list at the top level rather than
a region key: one thing is either in the pack from the start or carried
by one enemy instance in any region the Blueprint owns. Nothing here
reads the clock, the network or a model.
