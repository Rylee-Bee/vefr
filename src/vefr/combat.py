"""Surface-specific combat behavior.

The engine's surface field is a costume: packs declare
`surface: "combat" | "investigation" | "plain"` and the HUD
branches on it. This module is the small piece of server-side
behavior the costume needs:

  - HP values per phase, derived from the pack's own phase
    names. A pack with phases `dusk, dawn` gets HP=2 for dusk
    and HP=3 for dawn (later phases have more HP). The mapping
    is positional + simple; the costume is the point, not the
    formula.

  - The act's `verbs` list is the pack's own action vocabulary.
    When an act declares verbs, they ARE the allowed combat
    actions and the HUD's buttons; when it declares none, the
    engine's default costume verbs apply (back-compat).

  - POST /api/combat/action records a `combat_action` journal
    entry with the action's kind and an optional target. The
    engine doesn't have a turn system; the action just lives in
    the journal so the play log is complete.

How hard the numbers bite is the pack's law, not the engine's:
each act declares a `floor` (see world.py - "costume" by
default, where HP tracks as a number and the player never drops
to zero; "story" and "stakes" get their mechanics from rulesets
in future PRs). Under the default floor the old contract holds:
nothing the attack does can fail or end the game, and the
journal entry is honest.
