"""sections - Sections: the depth curve, the floor pattern, the landings.

PLAN.md section 2 is the spec. A Section is a pack file, `sections/<id>.json`,
holding everything one descent is made of: how many floors it has, how big
they are, what lives on them, and what each floor is FOR. This module is
the engine's read of that file, and it is pure - no clock, no model call,
no global, no dictionary iterated while a draw is consumed.

Everything here is one of four things:

- **where a floor is.** `locate(depth, pack)` turns a global depth into
  `(cycle, section, k)`, and `floor_key(run_seed, section, cycle, k)` names
  it. PLAN.md section 2 writes both, and the story is cycle 0.
- **what a floor is.** `pattern`, `slot`, `floor_kind` and `floor_size`:
  the four things a floor is drawn from, each on its own stream.
- **what the hero can get back to.** `landings`, `landing_flag` and
  `recorded_landings` are the elevator rule of PLAN.md section 4: two
  landings a Section, recorded permanently, and no lift down past a floor
  the hero has not reached.
- **what a floor is the same as.** `content_hash` and `identity` are the
  floor identity of PLAN.md section 2 - `(gen version, section content
  hash, floor_key)` - so that editing a pack's Section data invalidates
  that Section's floors rather than replaying old deltas onto new maps.

THE FLOOR KEY AND `delve_v3`

`floor_key` is what this slice means by a floor's name, and it is the
floor key `delve_v3.generate_floor_v3` builds for itself: that function
takes the RUN SEED as its `seed` and writes
`f"{seed}/{section.id}/{cycle}/{depth}"`, exactly the key
`floor_key(run_seed, section, cycle, k)` returns. The two are one string,
so `floor_key` here is the read and `delve_v3` is the writer of the same
identity - a caller must NOT hand `floor_key(...)` in as the seed, which
would build `run_seed/section.id/cycle/k/section.id/cycle/k` and name a
floor nothing else names. `floor_key` is what a caller still needs on its
own side: it is the key the size draw is salted with, and the key written
into the baked contract so a stair-time regeneration can name the floor.
Slice E3's JavaScript twin has to take the same key.

THE SIZE AND THE SPECIAL FLOOR

Two draws that are not in PLAN.md section 2's list of streams, both on
their own stream and both off the floor key:

- `|size` draws the floor's `w` then its `h` inside the Section's own
  `size` range. It is its own stream so that a pack that edits its room
  quota does not move a wall: the sub-seed rule of section 2 is the whole
  reason the stages do not share a stream.
- `|special` draws which of the Section's `specials` a `special` slot is,
  the way PLAN.md section 4's three kinds are meant to appear.

Both are one `floor(rng() * n)` draw with `n < 2^31`, which is the only
float PLAN.md section 2 allows, and both read a list that is already in
pack order.

TOUCH POINTS (written down before the first edit, as the slice asks)

| what | where |
|---|---|
| the Section pack shape | `shapes.SECTION` and its sub-blocks; `shapes.check_section` |
| the validator door | `maplab.section_block_errors`, called by `maplab.section_errors` |
| this module | `sections.py` |
| the sweep over Sections | `locks.section_findings`, printed by `cmd_map` |
| the bake | `cmd_delve --section`, which wires the doors and records the landings |
| the golden | `tests/golden/validator/cases.json`, block `section` |
| the tests | `tests/test_sections_e4.py`, two packs under `tests/fixtures/sections/` |

NOT IN THIS SLICE

The endless board itself - the tavern desk a hero chooses omens at, the
star each finished Section earns, and the collection rewards behind them -
is the slice after this one. This module answers the two questions the
board asks of the data: WHERE a depth past the story is (`cycle_locate`),
and WHAT the chosen omens do to the Section it is standing on
(`modifier`). The three special floor kinds are E9's - E4 draws WHICH of
them a special slot is and leaves the rest to `delve_v3`, which already
knows all three.

#   under the name the plan uses, delegated rather than written twice,
#   because two copies of a cap is one cap too many.
# - "The loot tier caps at Section 3's tier + 1." `loot_tier_cap` is that
#   cap, and `cycle_loot_tier` holds every depth to it in code rather
#   than in a comment - which is what makes `scripts/balance_report.py`
#   a gate rather than a printout.
#
# "The hero's level cap does not move" is stated here rather than
# enforced, because the hero's level lives in the save and not in a
# Section pack: a Section has no key that could raise it, which is the
# strongest form the guarantee takes on this side.

# ------------------------------------- omens as modifiers (slice E10, §4)
#
# "At each Section stair, the player picks 0-3 omens", and "each omen
# changes only its stated field". The second sentence is the whole of
# this half's design, so the API is shaped to make it provable rather than
# merely intended:
#
# - `omen_field(omen)` answers the ONE field an omen moves, and refuses
#   an omen that names none or two. `vefr check` says the same thing
#   with a sentence; this is what the engine would do about it.
# - `omen_delta(section, omens, field)` is the sum of the chosen omens'
#   deltas for ONE field, so nothing in this module can move two fields
#   by accident: there is no call here that returns a whole Section.
# - `modifier(section, cycle, omens)` is the one read that hands back
#   several fields at once, and it reads them each through its own
#   delta. A golden diff of `modifier` with and without one omen is the
#   acceptance test of the slice, and it shows one key moving.
#
# The three fields are `shapes.OMEN_FIELDS` and nothing else: the fog a
# Section sees by, the groups a floor may carry, and the affixes an
# endless cycle's warden draws (ADR 0015's `endless.affixes`, on the
# `loot|w` stream in cycles `c >= 1`). The other two omens PLAN.md
# section 4 lists by example - Restless and Lean - name fields this
