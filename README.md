# vefr

## What this is

VEFR turns a folder of your own writing into a story game you can walk
around in: a town to explore, people to talk to, items to find, and
short lines of story a language model writes for you. The engine and the
story stay apart — you bring the story, VEFR brings the world — so anyone
can point it at their own.

## Is it running?

**UNKNOWN.** Nothing in this repository can tell you what is running on
any machine, so ask the machine itself:

```sh
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8820/api/health
```

`{"ok": true, ...}` means the engine is up and answering
([`src/vefr/main.py`](src/vefr/main.py) is what serves it). *Connection
refused* means nothing is listening on that port. Anything else is a
fault worth a bug report, not a state.

## How to use it

Get the code and run it, from a checkout (Python 3.11+ and
[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Rylee-Bee/vefr.git
cd vefr
uv sync --group test
uv run uvicorn vefr.main:app --app-dir src --port 8820
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8820`. It is a walkable town: WASD or the
arrow keys to move, `E` or a tap to talk to whoever is nearby. The town
walks with no model at all — the parts that write prose tell you they
have no model, and the journal still records.

- **Start a world by hand:** copy `worlds/sample-world/` to
  `worlds/your-world/`, edit it, then run the engine with
  `VEFR_WORLD=your-world` in front of the same command.
- **Start a world by interview:** `uv run vefr chat --name your-world`
  asks questions and drafts the pack.
- **Check a pack:** `uv run vefr check --pack worlds/sample-world`.
- **Build one shareable file:** `uv run vefr weave` writes
  `dist/<name>-<date>.html` — a single HTML file that plays in any
  browser, with no server, no install and no model.
- **Run it as a container:** `podman compose up -d`
  ([`compose.yml`](compose.yml); install, volumes and image swaps are
  in [`docs/guides/install.md`](docs/guides/install.md)).
- **Every command:** `uv run vefr --help`.
