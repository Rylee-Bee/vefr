# World creation - from interview to a playable file

> One interview writes you a validated pack; one more command weaves
> it into a single HTML file you can open and play. Proven end to end
> 2026-09-22 against the bundled Spark (`:8083`): 15 prompts, exit 0,
> a valid pack in 25 seconds, a map extension through `build-map`,
> and a 37.9 KB single-file HTML with 10 woven pool lines.

## What you need

- A brain: the bundled fleet (`docs/guides/bundled-brain.md`) or any
  OpenAI-compatible backend pointed at with `VEFR_LLAMACPP_URL`.
- This repo, with `uv sync` done (`GETTING_STARTED.md`, step 1).

## The whole flow

```sh
uv run norns chat --name your-world                  # 1. the interview
uv run norns validate --pack worlds/your-world       # 2. the gate
uv run norns build-map --segments segs.json \
    --pack worlds/your-world                         # 3. optional: reshape the map
uv run ratatoskr weave --pool 2 --pack your-world    # 4. -> dist/your-world-<date>.html
```

Open the HTML in a browser, set your LLM URL + model in it, play — or
leave both blank to play offline from the woven pool.
`worlds/*` is gitignored - a throwaway world never touches git.

## 1. The interview

`norns chat` asks, in order (scaffold defaults in brackets):

| # | The question | Blank keeps | Behind it |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | What's your world called? [scaffold title] | scaffold title | becomes the pack's `world.json` title |
| 2 | In one or two sentences, what's the story? | - | the premise |
| 3 | Who is your protagonist, in a few words? | - | premise + protagonist -> the model drafts `logbok.md`, printed for you |
| 4 | the color mood (e.g. 'candlelit church', 'cold moonlit fen') | scaffold colors | theme draft, schema-constrained |
| 5 | Rename the phases? comma-separated, same count (2) | dusk, dawn | rewrites the phase keys |
| 6-7 | In a few words, what's the mood of 'dusk'? 'dawn'? | scaffold mood | one prose draft per phase |
| 8 | Rename the bonds? same count (3) | given, found, cold | renames how items connect to your protagonist |
| 9-11 | what does a '<bond>' bond feel like? | scaffold cards | a prose draft: card + prompt per bond |
| 12 | how should the town feel to walk? (e.g. 'tight lanes around a well') | scaffold layout | the map proposal - the hardest call |
| 13 | How many people stand in your town? (1-3, blank = 1) | one | each extra gets a "who else stands there?" + personality prompt |
| 14 | Your first townsperson is '<name>'. What should they be called? | scaffold name | |
| 15 | In a few words, who is <name>? | skips their drafts | a seed line per phase + a `voices/<file>.md` voice file |

Then: `checking your world...` runs the full validator - either
`ok - ... is valid and ready`, or a FAIL list naming what to fix by
hand, plus the next-steps commands.

Every question has a default. Blank keeps the scaffold's proven
piece, so even a fast, half-answered interview ends in a pack that
validates - the scaffold exists so the interview cannot strand you.

## 2. When a draft falls back

Every model call in the interview is schema-constrained and tries
twice before falling back. What the fallbacks look like, verbatim
from the dry run:

```text
  theme draft failed twice - keeping the scaffold's colors
  the map draft never validated twice - keeping the scaffold's
  proven layout (always try: norns validate --pack worlds/<name>)
```

The map proposal is the hardest ask in the whole flow: the model
must emit run-length rows at the scaffold's exact dimensions, using
only the scaffold's legend characters, that pass `maplab.validate()`
in place - geometry, reachability from the hero's start, every
speaker still on walkable ground. In the dry run every prose draft
(canon, phase moods, bond cards, voice, seeds) landed on the 0.6B
Spark while both gated structured drafts fell back. A bigger brain
narrows that gap:

```sh
VEFR_LLAMACPP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8084 uv run norns chat --name your-world
```

A prose draft that fails twice becomes a plain placeholder instead -
you always get something to edit, never a crash mid-interview.

## 3. Reshaping the map later

`norns build-map` rebuilds the town map from a run-length segments
file - `{"rows": [[["H", 4], ["#", 12], ...], ...]}`, one
`[character, count]` pair run per row, every row the same width:

```sh
uv run norns build-map --segments segs.json --pack worlds/your-world
uv run norns validate --pack worlds/your-world
```

Dry run: a one-row extension (10 -> 11 rows, width 12), run
unforced. `build-map` validates before writing - bad geometry never
lands unless you pass `--force` (then fix it and validate anyway).
The validator after any map write is not optional; hand edits
included.

## 4. Weave it into one file

```sh
VEFR_LLAMACPP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8083 \
    uv run ratatoskr weave --pool 2 --pack your-world
```

`--pool N` needs a live model: it pre-generates N real lines per
combination (dry run: 10 lines across `rumor:dusk`, `rumor:dawn`,
`letter`, `forge`), then writes `dist/your-world-<date>.html`. Open
it in any browser: the file carries the whole pack, and it plays
completely without a model (see `docs/adr/0003`). By default the game
never mentions models. To offer players an optional model of their own
for fresh lines, add `"model": "optional"` to the `player` block below;
it then appears under Model settings in the pause menu.

### The title screen

The shared file opens on a title picture. By default it's the World
Tree's front door; give your game its own, and an accent colour for
its buttons, in `world.json`:

```json
"player": {
  "title_art": "assets/title.webp",
  "accent": "#C98049",
  "model": "optional"
}
```

`title_art` is a path inside your pack (WebP, PNG or JPEG; around
1400px wide keeps the file small). `accent` is a six-digit hex colour;
the button text turns dark or light to stay readable on it. `model` is
optional too; leave it out and the game offers no model at all.

## Where your world lives

```text
worlds/your-world/
├── world.json         # pack root: title, phases, bonds, voices
├── logbok.md          # the canon the interview drafted
├── map.md             # the town map
├── ledger.md          # generation log
├── world-tree.md      # act/POI overview
├── voices/            # speaker voice files (+ fragments)
├── assets/kenney/     # tileset art + licenses
└── acts/act-1/        # act shape: world.json, town/ (contract,
                       # map.md, sprites/, voices/)
```

The contract for every field lives in `src/vefr/world.py`. The
interview writes it; `norns validate` checks it; you can hand-edit
any of it - then validate again, because the tool never trusts your
edit, including the engine's own.

## Cleaning up

```sh
rm -rf worlds/your-world    # gitignored - git status stays clean
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Truth |
|---|---|
| drafts keep falling back | the smallest brain strains on gated structured drafts - point the interview at `:8084` or any bigger backend |
| `validate` FAIL after a hand edit | the validator names the file and reason; fix, re-run `norns validate --pack worlds/<name>` |
| `build-map` refused to write | validation failed before the write - fix the segments (`--force` writes anyway, then validate) |
| brain unreachable during play | engine-time generation fails closed (an error, never invented lore); the interview itself degrades to scaffold + placeholders |
