# 0017 - Rolled loot: rarity at once, traits hidden

Date: 2026-10-10

## Status

**Proposed.** Slice 1 of 3 for phase 3. Becomes Accepted when all three slices land: this one (rolled loot), then identify-as-a-town-service, then bag capacity.

Slice 1 is landed and proven (see Acceptance below). Slices 2 and 3 are deliberately **not** in this ADR's scope and no part of this slice pretends to them: there is no identify service, no reveal moment, no bag size and no bag upgrade. What a thing's traits *do* is still undefined, and that stays an open question rather than a guess.

Rylee's picks this follows (2026-10-08): loot goes "Before E8 vaults"; the town gives "Rest, trade, identify"; danger rises. The brief for this slice is `docs/packets/`'s T3 packet.

## Context

There was no rarity and no identify machinery anywhere in the repo. An item was a `world.json` `items` entry - words, a sprite, and what it does - and `src/vefr/world.py` said so in one line: **"Nothing is identified yet."** The loot slice of `docs/guides/rulesets.md` said, of the same subject: **"Deterministic like the rest - fixed ids, no randomness, no model call."**

That last sentence is the tension this ADR has to settle honestly rather than paper over. The rule this engine actually holds is not "no randomness" but the determinism rule: **every draw comes from a named seeded stream off the run seed, no `Math.random`, no clock, no globals, no float arithmetic beyond `int(rng() * n)`** (`docs/packets/equip-engine-a2.md`; PLAN §8's sub-seed rule). A weighted draw off a named stream is deterministic in exactly the sense every other draw in this engine is - the same seed gives the same floor, the same monster, the same hit points, the same drop, the same rarity, the same traits. So the sentence in `rulesets.md` is not contradicted by this slice; it is *narrowed*, and the guide says so in place. What this slice adds is a second and third draw inside the one the engine already made, not an unseeded one.

Two sentences in the tree say "not yet" about identification, and both stay true after this slice rather than being rewritten to sound bigger:

- `src/vefr/world.py` - now: nothing identifies a thing yet; ADR 0017 gives a drop hidden traits and an `identified` flag that starts false, and nothing in this slice ever turns it true.
- `web/player/parts/160-the-bag.js:9` - now: no weight, no dropping, no identifying yet. Still true: this slice adds a word next to the thing's name and nothing else about identification.
- `web/player/parts/430-loot-on-the-floor.js` - now: a drop may carry the rarity it was drawn at and the traits it is hiding; identifying is the slice after this one.

## Decision

### The pack contract: three optional keys

An `items` entry may carry three new keys. Every one is optional, every one is additive, and an item that names none of them bakes and drops exactly what it did before.

```json
"items": {
  "cloudy-potion": {
    "name": "a cloudy potion", "sprite": "potion", "heal": 3, "use": "drink",
    "rarity": "common",
    "traits": ["keen"],
    "roll": {
      "rarity": {"common": 60, "uncommon": 30, "rare": 10},
      "traits": ["keen", "brave", "swift", "cold"],
      "chance": 60,
      "max": 2
    }
  }
}
```

- **`rarity`** - one plain word. On an item with no `roll`, the fixed rarity the thing is. On an item with a `roll`, it must be one of the names that item's own `roll.rarity` declares.
- **`traits`** - a list of plain words. Fixed, like `rarity`, when there is no `roll`.
- **`roll`** - `rarity` (required, a table of pack-chosen names and whole weights), `traits` (the pool), `chance` (int 0..100, how often a draw bears a trait at all; default 100 when a pool is named), `max` (int 0..4, how many at once; default 1).

The rarity names are the pack's. There is no closed vocabulary and no ordering the engine imposes: `common` and `odd` and `bramble` are all rarity names. A plain word is `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_-]{0,23}` (`shapes.WORD`) - one thing the bag can print, never a sentence that reads as two traits in a sentence.

`shapes.ITEM` is the block that states the whole item and `shapes.ROLL` the block inside it; both are registered in `shapes.BLOCKS`. `shapes.check_item`, not `check`, is the entry point, and it reads only `rarity`, `traits` and `roll`. The other nine keys are in the table so the table states the whole item, and are deliberately not re-checked there: every one of them accepts something today (a `value` of 0, a `heal` of "lots", a `use` of `"  "`, and any key the engine has never heard of), and a check that began refusing them would refuse packs that were never wrong about them.

### The draw

One drop draw yields a base item, and then, for that item, a rarity and some traits:

| stream | seed | spends |
|---|---|---|
| the base id | `v3\|<floor key>\|loot\|<mob id>` | one `int(rng() * len(ids))` - unchanged |
| the roll | `v3\|<floor key>\|roll\|<mob id>\|<item id>` | the rarity, then the traits |

The roll stream is named off the same floor key and the same monster the base draw came from, and the item id is in the name so a monster that could carry two rolled things gives each its own stream. Consequences, all pinned by tests: the base draw cannot move when a roll is added, two monsters never share a roll, and the order monsters are killed in cannot change what any of them drop (PLAN §8's sub-seed rule).

The order of the draws is fixed and is part of the contract, because the two languages must agree:

1. the rarity - `int(rng() * total)` over the pack's whole weights, then a walk down them;
2. whether the thing bears a trait at all - `int(rng() * 100) >= chance`;
3. how many - `1 + int(rng() * max)`, capped by the pool;
4. which - `int(rng() * len(left))` over what is left, so two traits never come back the same word.

Every one of those is `int(rng() * n)` with an `n` the pack's own whole numbers built. `maplab.RARITY_NAMES_MAX` (64), `RARITY_WEIGHT_MAX` (9999) and `TRAIT_POOL_MAX` (16) are the bounds that keep the product under 2**31, and they are the draw's bounds rather than an author's taste.

**Where a draw happens.** A draw needs a stream, so it happens where there is one: a monster's drop on a generated floor. A drop with no floor key to seed it - a town enemy, a chest, a rule that puts a thing on the floor - carries the item's **fixed** `rarity`/`traits` and draws nothing.

### What rides on the drop, and on the instance in the bag

A drawn drop is a record; an undrawn one is still the bare id it has always been:

```json
{"item": "cloudy-potion", "rarity": "uncommon", "traits": ["cold"], "identified": false}
```

`identified` is false on every instance and **nothing in this slice sets it true** - that is the next slice, and `web/player/parts/180-gold.js` is written so that turning it on is one line. The instance rides on the floor record and then into `localStorage['vefr-bag-<world>']`, which is now a list whose entries are either a bare id (every bag before this slice, and every bag of a pack that declares no roll) or an instance record. `bagCarried()` reads both the same way.

### The reveal

The bag strip, the bag panel and the pickup line name the thing **and its rarity together**, at once, from the moment of pickup: "a cloudy potion (uncommon)". The traits are in no part of the page - not in a row, not in a tooltip, not in an attribute - while `identified` is false. The strip's `aria-label` carries the same words, so a screen reader hears what the eye sees.

**Motion.** This slice adds no animation and no delay: the rarity is written into the same string as the name, in the same pass. So with reduced motion on - and with it off - the reveal is instant and identical. There is nothing to switch off, which is the strongest form the requirement can take; the reveal moment itself is slice 2's, and when that arrives the motion-off rule is one `prefers-reduced-motion` check away in the one place that animates.

### The refusals

Four, each one plain sentence naming the item and the field:

1. a `rarity` that is not one of the names the item's own `roll` declares;
2. a trait that is not one plain word (in the item's `traits` or in a roll's pool);
3. a `roll` with no rarity table, or a table with no whole weight in it;
4. a `roll` that asks for traits (`traits`, `chance` or `max`) and names no pool.

A refusal means the item draws nothing at all rather than half a roll: an unusable roll is a no-op in play, and the sentence is the pack author's.

## Compatibility

**Every new key is optional and additive, and no existing value changes meaning.** `maplab.item_roll_of` is the single reader the validator, the bake and the draw share, so the pack's words and the player's roll cannot drift apart.

The proof, on `worlds/sample-world` (a pack that declares no `rarity`, no `traits` and no `roll`), pristine `main` against this branch:

- the woven `VEFR_ITEMS` line, sha256 `3997a2ea7deea05adf61b9d51bcf6c54972dc489e85180b6f632caa4774d47a9` on both;
- every drop drawn on twelve floors and three runs, sha256 `7a3006b669db87c889c914841e75e70fbeae3f03ffe4b8d34d2abb671140f0fc` on both, and the same again with the catalog handed to `floor_plan`.

`mob_drops`, `mobs_at`, `_with_warden` and `floor_plan` all take the catalog as an **optional** argument defaulting to `None`, and the JavaScript twin reads `window.VEFR_ITEMS` where the weave already writes it. A caller written before this slice gets the same list of bare ids.

The saved bag is read as either shape and the saved floor record carries the extra fields only when a drop has them, so a save written by an older build reads identically and a save written by this one reads identically in an older build (the extra keys are simply not there).

## Acceptance

- `uv run --group test pytest -q` green, with the failures on `main` unchanged.
- `tests/test_rolled_loot.py` - the shape, the four refusals, the draw's determinism (same seed twice, different keys and monsters differ, the base id does not move, every stream named), the backward-compatibility hashes, the reveal's own words, and the static proof that nothing in the reveal path animates or waits.
- `tests/test_rolled_loot_play.py` - the real woven player in jsdom: the bag names the thing and its rarity, the traits are in no part of the page, the instance survives a reload, and a bag saved before this slice still reads.
- `tests/test_descent_parity.py` - the same cellar drawn in both languages with a rolled catalog planted: the whole drop, base id, rarity and traits, must match field for field.

**Every refusal goes red when it is removed.** Each of the four was mutated out of `src/vefr/maplab.py` (or, for the trait word, out of `shapes.py`'s `words` kind) in turn, and its own test failed with nothing else failing.

## What this slice does not do

- **Identify as a service.** Nothing turns `identified` true. Slice 2.
- **The reveal moment.** The rarity is simply there from the pickup; there is no unfolding, no toast, no animation, and none is promised here.
- **What a trait does.** Read in, stored, hidden, never rendered. Whether a trait changes a number, changes a line, or is only ever flavour is an open question for slice 2 or 3 - it is a *pack data* question the moment the reveal exists, and guessing now would put a half-decided mechanic in the pack contract.
- **Bag capacity, weight, selling changes, grids, equipment.** Out of scope; slots and bag upgrades are slices 3 and later.
- **Rolled drops outside a generated floor.** A town enemy or a chest with no stream carries the item's fixed rarity and traits, unchanged.

## Open questions

1. Do traits change numbers, or are they words the player reads? (Owner.)
2. Does a fixed `rarity` on an unrolled item make it a "rare" thing for any future shop, sell or bag-capacity rule, or is it only ever a word in the bag?
3. Should the bag's save format grow a version marker when slice 2 starts writing `identified: true`?
4. Is a drop's rarity rolled from its own table every time, or can a Section bias it (an elite's drop being rarer than a rat's)?
